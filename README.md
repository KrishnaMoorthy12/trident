# Trident Text Editor

### _A new Free and Open Source, classical and powerful text editor made with Java Swing package and passion!_

## What's new

- #### Auto Saver
	- Saves an extra copy of your file as filename-autoSaved with appropriate extension to avoid any loss of work and to save your life!
	- Also saves any temporary work in "New File" in your home directory as a txt file.
	- These get deleted automatically once you close Trident
	- They will be left befind in case of any accidental exits such as power shutdown, app crash, force close etc.

- #### Redefined compiler [Windows Only]
	- Compiles/ Runs Python, Java, C, C++
	- When you run a HTML file, it'll be opened in Browser
	- Now you can give inputs - Opens a console window
	- *-output files are no longer created, any message from compiler is directly shown to user
	- For java, you need to keep main class name as the file name in order to run
	- You can also run .class files
	- C compiler uses C99 standards to avoid undesirable 'forbids' errors.
	- The Trident Compiler only utilizes the existing resources of your system, so it is mandatory to have the curresonding compilers installed and their path being added to the environment variables.
